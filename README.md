# 📬 Responsive Contact Form (HTML + SCSS)

A clean and responsive contact form built using semantic HTML and modular SCSS.  
This project was created as part of my front-end development practice to focus on layout design, form styling, and responsive techniques without relying on JavaScript or backend logic.
